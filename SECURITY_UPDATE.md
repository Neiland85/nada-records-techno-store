# Security Update Migration

## Changes Made

### 1. JWT Library Migration
- **Replaced**: `python-jose[cryptography]==3.3.0`
- **With**: `PyJWT[crypto]==2.8.0`
- **Reason**: python-jose has critical security vulnerabilities:
  - Algorithm confusion with OpenSSH ECDSA keys (CVE-2024-33663)
  - Denial of service via compressed JWE content (CVE-2024-33664)

### 2. python-multipart Critical Updates
- **Updated**: `python-multipart` from `0.0.6` to `0.0.9`
- **Reason**: Multiple critical DoS vulnerabilities:
  - Denial of service via deformation multipart/form-data boundary
  - Content-Type Header ReDoS vulnerability

### 3. Pillow Security Update
- **Updated**: `Pillow` from `10.2.0` to `10.3.0`
- **Reason**: Buffer overflow vulnerability (High severity)

### 4. Sentry SDK Update
- **Updated**: `sentry-sdk[fastapi]` from `1.38.0` to `1.47.0`
- **Reason**: Environment variables exposure to subprocesses

### 5. Additional Security Updates
- **FastAPI**: Updated from `0.104.1` to `0.105.0`
- **SQLAlchemy**: Updated from `2.0.23` to `2.0.25`
- **httpx**: Updated from `0.25.2` to `0.26.0`
- **pytest**: Updated from `7.4.3` to `7.4.4`
- **pytest-asyncio**: Updated from `0.21.1` to `0.23.2`
- **bcrypt**: Updated from `4.1.1` to `4.2.0`
- **alembic**: Updated from `1.12.1` to `1.13.1`
- **pydantic**: Updated from `2.5.0` to `2.5.2`

### 6. Code Changes
- Updated `backend/app/api/deps/auth.py` to use PyJWT instead of python-jose
- Fixed import statements and error handling
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing token structure
- Improved timezone handling using `datetime.timezone.utc`
- Cleaned up duplicate dependencies in requirements.txt

## Testing Required
- [ ] Test JWT token generation and validation
- [ ] Test authentication endpoints
- [ ] Test file upload endpoints (multipart/form-data)
- [ ] Test image processing with Pillow
- [ ] Verify no breaking changes in token format
- [ ] Run security scans to confirm vulnerabilities are resolved

## Breaking Changes
None - The JWT token format and API remain the same.

## Security Impact
- ✅ Resolves CVE-2024-33663 (Critical) - JWT algorithm confusion
- ✅ Resolves CVE-2024-33664 (Moderate) - JWT DoS via compressed JWE
- ✅ Resolves python-multipart DoS vulnerabilities (High)
- ✅ Resolves python-multipart ReDoS vulnerability (High)
- ✅ Resolves Pillow buffer overflow (High)
- ✅ Resolves Sentry environment variable exposure (Low)
- ✅ General security improvements through dependency updates
